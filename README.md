# Pico Firmware

This uses docker to setup an image with the required dependencies for building the firmware. Its driven by targets in a makefile as described below

## First Time Setup

This will setup the docker container for building the firmware

```
make
```

## Build
```
make build
```

## Upload
```
make upload
```

## Connect over usb
```
make usb
```
